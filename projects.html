<h2> Channel Validations</h2>

<p>
One of my primary responsibilities as an intern at <b>Paramount</b> was ensuring the seamless transmission of broadcast channels across a wide portfolio of networks,
including <b>CBS</b>, <b>MTV</b>, <b>Showtime</b>, <b>Comedy Central</b>, <b>Nickelodeon</b>, and <b>Pluto TV</b>. A key part of this role involved validating each channel’s audio and video streams,
including alternate language tracks, to confirm that all broadcast paths are fully functional and meet quality standards.
<p>
Within the facility, there is a space known as the PRISM room, which is a central monitoring hub equipped with dozens of screens displaying
live feeds from across our channel lineup. During validations, I used a structured spreadsheet to systematically log
the status of each feed, which was essential for identifying potential issues. When a problem was detected,
I documented detailed notes outlining the nature and specifics of the anomaly.
</p>
<p>
An additional layer of my monitoring responsibilities involved managing "penalties"—situations where a channel experiences prolonged loss of audio or video, triggering an alert that places the channel into what is called the “penalty box.” When this happens, part of the process is opening and assessing the channel to determine whether the issue is critical. Often, it’s something benign, like the closing credits of a movie or a promotional graphic, but close attention is required to ensure it doesn’t develop into a more serious outage. To facilitate this process, I would use a platform called <b>VistaLINK</b>, which allows for targeted monitoring of any broadcast feed and its associated paths. When further investigation is needed, I would use a program called <b>Mediaproxy</b>, which would allow me to review past footage from channels by timestamp. This feature is crucial for validating whether an alert reflects a legitimate issue or a false alarm.
</p>

<p>
Another common issue I would monitor is visual distortion caused by bitrate drops, which can affect
individual channels or entire networks. To diagnose these, I relied on <b>Medius</b>, a platform
that tracks historical bitrate data across all paths. This tool would help me determine whether
a bitrate fluctuation is an isolated incident or indicative of a broader technical problem.
</p>
<p>
A project I supported during my time at <b>Paramount</b> involved consolidating two <b>Paramount</b> facilities in Hauppauge:
The NOC and CCC buildings. With the NOC building set to be decommissioned by December 2025, the company actively
migrated all associated channels to the CCC. This process involved rigorous testing of each channel’s video
output and audio tracks. The goal of the project was to ensure that the feeds from the NOC function properly at the CCC so the
two buildings can successfully merge.
</p>
<p>
Overall, channel monitoring and validation were one of the most rewarding aspects of my internship. It deepened my understanding of the broadcast process from a technical perspective and strengthened my ability to identify genuine issues in these environments.
</p>

<h2> Databases/Airtable</h2>

<p>
Another key component of this internship was developing and managing databases using <b>Airtable</b>, a versatile
cloud-based platform that supports real-time collaboration and data organization. Leveraging <b>Airtable</b> allowed me to
stay highly organized and efficient while performing various tasks, particularly during the channel validation process.
</p>
<p>
As part of this process, I created a reusable, automated table designed to track the status of each channel and its corresponding
signal paths. The table included selectable status options—“GOOD” for fully functional paths and “ISSUE” for
any detected problems—along with designated fields for entering detailed notes on the nature of any technical issues.
</p>
<p>
Once the validation process is completed for all channels, a built-in command labeled “WIPE” resets the table,
enabling it to be reused daily without needing to recreate or manually clear the data. This automation significantly
improved workflow efficiency and ensured consistency in daily monitoring procedures.

<p>
Learning to effectively utilize <b>Airtable</b> was one of the essential skills I’ve developed during my time at <b>Paramount</b>.
It enhanced my ability to manage complex datasets, streamline processes, and maintain clear documentation, which are capabilities that are vital in an
industry where the volume of technical information is both high and constantly evolving. I believe this skill set will be highly valuable in any future professional
setting, especially in broadcast and media environments where data accuracy and operational organization are critical.
