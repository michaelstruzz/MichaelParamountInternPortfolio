  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p>Hi, I’m Michael Struzzieri — a Broadcasting Streaming Specialist Intern at <b>Paramount</b>.
  </p>


<p>
I joined <b>Paramount</b> in June 2025, and since then, I’ve had the opportunity to work closely with the company’s live streaming and broadcast operations teams. My role involves supporting live event workflows, monitoring network feeds, and ensuring seamless broadcast delivery across multiple platforms. This experience has helped me develop a strong understanding of real-time production environments, technical troubleshooting, and the evolving landscape of digital media.
</p>

<p>
So far, I’ve had the opportunity to connect with many amazing people who have supported my growth both personally and professionally. While my journey at this company is still ongoing, the experience I’ve gained has been truly valuable, and I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished so far.
