<p> This Summer I worked as a Broadcast Streaming Specialist on Paramount's Broadcast Operations team.
    Our summer project involved working on the migration of hardware playout systems
    to the Cloud, from the Networks Operations Center to the Cloud Control Center. This involved understanding
    the downstream process of how content travels from source to destination and all of the avenues
    in between. Majority of our work involved systems testing and quality control, which built upon that
    understanding of the content delivery process. 
    Our team worked cross functionally with Tech-Ops, Programming, Distribution, Integration, Engineering and more 
    which helped to give a comprehensive overview of the content workflows as well as learn effective communication
    across different groups.
