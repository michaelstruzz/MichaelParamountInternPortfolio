  <p>This summer I worked as a Broadcast Streaming Specialist on Paramount's Broadcast Operations team.
     Our summer project involved working on the migration of hardware playout systems to the Cloud,
     from the Network Operations Center to the Cloud Control Center. This involved understanding
     the downstream process of how content travels from source to destination and all of the avenues
     in between. Most of our work involved systems testing and quality control, which built upon that
     understanding of the content delivery process. Our team worked cross-functionally with Tech-Ops,
     Programming, Distribution, Integration, Engineering and more, which helped to give a comprehensive
     overview of the content workflows as well as to learn effective communication across different groups.
