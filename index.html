  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p>
 Hi, my name is Michael Struzzieri. I am a former Broadcasting Streaming Specialist Intern at <b>Paramount</b>.
</p>

<p>
I joined <b>Paramount</b> in June 2025 and was there through October 2025. During that time, I had the opportunity to work closely with the company’s live-streaming and broadcast operations teams. My role involved supporting live event workflows, monitoring network feeds, and ensuring seamless broadcast delivery across multiple platforms. This experience helped me develop a strong understanding of real-time production environments, technical troubleshooting, and the evolving landscape of digital media.
</p>

<p>
I had the opportunity to connect with many amazing people who supported my growth both personally and professionally. The experience I’ve gained at <b>Paramount</b> was truly valuable, and I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished in my time working there.
