<h1> In Conclusion...</h1>
<p>
    My journey at <b>Paramount</b> was amazing, and I deeply value and appreciate everything I’ve learned
    as an intern in the broadcast operations department. This experience provided me with meaningful insight into
    the inner workings of the broadcast and media industry, while equipping me with technical skills and professional knowledge that
    I will carry throughout my career. As a student preparing to graduate by December 2025, my time at <b>Paramount</b> has significantly boosted my confidence and
    affirmed my passion for pursuing a full-time role in the industry I am genuinely enthusiastic about. The hands-on exposure and mentorship I received have made a lasting impact, and I’m excited to build
    on this foundation as I take the next step in my professional journey.
